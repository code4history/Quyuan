# vulnerability-fix Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change remove-lit-dependency. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Secure Dependencies
The system SHALL ensure known high/moderate vulnerabilities are resolved.

#### Scenario: Vue Template Compiler Override
-   **Given** `package.json`
-   **When** a `pnpm.overrides` field is added
-   **Then** it should force `vue-template-compiler` to a fixed version (e.g., `^2.7.16`)
-   **And** `pnpm audit` should report 0 vulnerabilities (or at least resolve the specific one)
